# Stars-Only Billing System Implementation

## 🌟 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Stars-only billing system with pass-based quotas, pay-as-you-go options, and automatic quota management. This replaces traditional payment methods with Telegram Stars (XTR) for seamless in-app purchases.

## 💰 Pricing Structure

### Passes (Better Value)
- **1-Day Pro Pass**: 499 ⭐ → 50 FLUX + 10 Kling (61.8% margin)
- **7-Day Creator Pass**: 2,999 ⭐ → 500 FLUX + 50 Kling (42.5% margin)  
- **30-Day Studio Pass**: 9,999 ⭐ → 2,000 FLUX + 200 Kling (31.1% margin)

### Pay-as-you-go (Instant Access)
- **Extra FLUX**: 25 ⭐ per generation (88% margin)
- **Extra Kling**: 50 ⭐ per animation (92% margin)

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **StarsBillingManager** (`src/stars_billing.py`)
   - Pass management with Redis TTL
   - Quota tracking with atomic operations
   - Stars invoice creation (XTR currency)
   - Automatic refunds on failure
   - Upsell prompts when quota depleted

2. **Bot Integration** (`src/bot.py`)
   - New commands: `/quota`, `/buy`, `/style`, `/video`, `/help`
   - Quota checking before generation
   - Automatic quota consumption/refund
   - Stars payment handler alongside traditional payments
   - Enhanced main menu with billing buttons

3. **Localization** (`config/locales/`)
   - English and Russian billing strings
   - Pass descriptions and status messages
   - Upsell and error messages

### Redis Schema

```
user:{user_id}:pass         # Pass information (TTL = pass duration)
user:{user_id}:quota:flux   # FLUX quota (TTL = pass duration or 30 days)
user:{user_id}:quota:kling  # Kling quota (TTL = pass duration or 30 days)
```

### Bot Commands

- **`/quota`** - Check current quota and pass status
- **`/buy`** - Show billing menu with passes and pay-as-you-go
- **`/style`** - Quick style transfer (checks FLUX quota)
- **`/video`** - Quick video/animation (checks Kling quota)  
- **`/help`** - Comprehensive help with billing info

## 🔄 User Flow

### Purchase Flow
1. User triggers `/buy` or clicks billing buttons
2. Shows current status and available options
3. User selects pass or pay-as-you-go item
4. Creates Stars invoice with XTR currency
5. Telegram handles Stars payment
6. Bot activates pass or adds quota on success

### Generation Flow
1. User uploads photo and selects style/animation
2. Bot checks quota for service (FLUX/Kling)
3. If insufficient, shows upsell message
4. If sufficient, consumes quota atomically
5. Processes image/video
6. Refunds quota if processing fails

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Quota Protection
- **Atomic Operations**: Redis pipelines prevent race conditions
- **Automatic Refunds**: Failed generations refund quota
- **TTL Management**: Quotas expire with passes
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to upsell on quota depletion

### Error Handling
- API failures trigger quota refunds
- Network errors retry with exponential backoff
- Invalid payments logged for support
- Comprehensive error messages for users

## 📊 Monitoring Points

### Key Metrics
- Pass purchase rates by type
- Quota consumption patterns
- Refund rates (should be <5%)
- Conversion from free to paid users
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)

### Alerts Setup
- High refund rates (>10%)
- Redis connection failures
- Stars payment processing errors
- Quota inconsistencies

## 🚀 Deployment

### Pre-deployment Checklist
- ✅ All tests passing (`python test_stars_billing.py`)
- ✅ Localization complete (EN/RU)
- ✅ Redis connection tested
- ✅ Bot syntax validated
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive

### Deploy Command
```bash
./automation/deploy_and_monitor.sh "Implement Stars-only billing system with passes and quotas"
```

### Post-deployment Testing
1. Test all commands: `/quota`, `/buy`, `/style`, `/video`, `/help`
2. Verify Stars payment flow (small test purchases)
3. Test quota consumption and refunds
4. Verify pass expiration handling
5. Test upsell messages when quota depleted

## 🔧 Configuration
